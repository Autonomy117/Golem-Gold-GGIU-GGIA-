 Golem Gold the hash investment token. Hash power made into cyrptocurrency investment. 
 
 I introduce to you Golem gold concept,This token represents proof of stake to be exchanged for a share of mined bitcoins. 
 The aim of the Golem project is to create a global prosumer market for computing power.
 The aim of Golem Gold is to   turn any sum of hash/computing power into cyrptocurrency investment. 

example john grew up in africa where there is not much computers to be seen for mile but everyone sure do have 
smartphones which are able to mine bitcoin with many different apps such as "Minergate & Crypto Miner" to name a 
few.However doing such a thing would be unprofitable for john.

The structure to be built should enable john to join a huge collection of miners that will pool together with 
whatever device they can mine with offering what little computing powe. With john's agreed upon that the given 
computer hash power be treated like an investment as he would treat his money. 

Golem gold's intention is to provide each miner with a share of Golem gold coins to keep as proof of stake for the 
mining that was done. 


Calculation of shares route 1: Unclear

Why ? isn't that sorta like mining golem then ? yes it is how ever the bitcoin is too small of a profit to send so 
the sum of bitcoin should be called payment#1, each miner has a pecentage of payment#1 so they will be sent Golem 
Gold tokens for that specific percentage of payment#1 that hey own example ; john provided 3% of the mining power 
for payment#1, so john should recieve 3 Golem gold tokens for payment#1. " 3.0000 GGP#1 "

Note: Golem gold does not use transaction fees

Now that john has Some golem gold tokens in his wallet :  The bitcoin is to be invested in ICOs. The Golem gold 
wallet will be populated with a list of Ongoing and Upcoming ICOs that has the most potential with a pre-selected 
recommendation. john has the choice to alocate his 3 golem gold where he wishes before the ICOs deadline "the 
dealine in golem gold is sooner than the actual". John then waits until that ipo is profitable x200+ or 1year which 
ever comes first. 

like any investment default can happen eg the ICOs failed/scrapped.

John get paid in bitcoin and must have a bitcoin wallet ready at time of payout.



Calculation of shares route 2: 

The the total sum of hash rate will be measured in Th/s. example: john's device/s only contributed 3000 Kh/s to this to 
the total 3000Th/s that accomplished the bitcoin. a Golem gold unit is equivalent to 1Mh/s so john only provided 0.003 
Mh/s to the total 43Th/s and he should recieve 0.003 Golem gold "0.003 GG" which john can send away to a freind or 
sell as he likes. 

John = 3000Kh/s
pool = 3000Th/s
1 Golem gold = 1 Mh/s

GGIU = john/Golem Gold
3000/1000 000 = 0.003 

John has 0.003 GGIU = 0.0000001% shares in the ivestment to be made

percent  shares = (john/pool)*100 
(3000/3 000 000 000 000)*100 = 0.0000001%

Note a Share of Golem gold is determined after 1.0 unit of a coin is mined. In this case at 3000Th/s at 1 BTC = $2584,
1.06 BTC would be mined each day at sum 2737.74, thats 19.16/week, 82.13/month and 999.28/year
to be invested in ICOs for x200+ returns.


Golem gold has just turned computing work that was already done into a cyrptocurrency investment represented by the 

"GGIA" & "GGIU" abbreviation. 

GGIA - golem gold token that are invested in an ICO

GGIU - Golem gold tokens that are not yet invested in anything

Note: "Golem gold has no network transaction fees" 

The Golem gold wallet will be populated with a list of Ongoing and Upcoming ICOs that has the most potential with a 
pre-selected recommendation. john has the choice to alocate his 0.003 golem gold where he wishes before that 
specific ICO deadline "the dealine in golem gold is sooner than the actual ICO deadline". The the percentage of 
bitcoins that the Golem gold tokens represent will be used to add to the funding to buy into the ICO "like a 
crowdfunding or online investment procedure which only take effect if the fund recieves enough donations". 

John then has to choose to wait until that ICO is profitable by it meeting one of the pay out requirements which is 
set by the Golem team and cannot be edited. It automatically takes effect when Golem team cashes out that investment 

in return for Bitcoin.

2. Automatically take profit if ICO price reaches x amount of USD or BTC

3. Take profit in x amount of year/s 
 

like any investment default can happen eg. the ICOs failed/scrapped etc. 
"good thing you need not spend any money to gain tokens"
John gets paid in bitcoin and must have a bitcoin wallet ready at time of payout.


BENEFITS & Specifications:

tokens are only created after work is done

tokens has a clear purpose which is to be invested or to cliam an investment's payoff

if john decides to sent a share of his Golem gold token to a friend.
That friend will be able to claim the respective investment return of bitcoin for that amount of Golem gold.

This enables men women and children living anywhere in the world to be able to have 
shares in a company that may payoff big in the long run. by just installing a mining application.

Only CPU mining is accepted. this is to keep big GPUs & Asics out of it.
